## Double LGBMRegressor For Electricity Generation Prediction


<h4><center>:sunglasses: Electricity-Generation-Prediction :sunglasses:</center></h4>

How much electricity can a stem turbine generate? In this competition, our aim is to predict the unit load power generation based on the given factors of a steam turbine in specific working environments. This competition is hosted by ML GDEs or TFUGs, sponsored by Google Developers.
